# Prediction-of-building-energy-requirements
 The city of Seattle has a goal of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050. <br/>
 The city has an

 and they update their information according to the amount of data that is brought in. <br/>
 Careful surveys were done in 2015 and 2016, however, these surveys are expensive to obtain. <br/>
 The objective of this project was therefore to predict CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of buildings for which they have not yet been measured.
 
 ## Conduct of the study
 
1 - Description and cleaning of the dataset <br/>
2 - Warning about data leakage <br/>
3 - Exploration of the dataset <br/>
4 - Comparison of prediction models <br/>
5 - Evaluation of the interest of the ENERGY STAR score <br/>
6 - Final models selected <br/>
